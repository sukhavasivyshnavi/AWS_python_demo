# AWS Python Demo Project

This project showcases my ability to work with AWS services using Python.

## 🔧 What I Used
- 🗃️ Amazon S3 – to store and retrieve files from a bucket
- 💻 EC2 Instance – to run Python scripts (optional, stopped now)
- 🔐 IAM – to manage access credentials
- 🐍 Python (boto3) – AWS SDK for Python

## 📁 Files
- `upload_to_s3.py`: Uploads a file from local to an AWS S3 bucket
- `demo_file.txt`: Sample file to be uploaded
- `/screenshots/`: Images of EC2 & S3 setup
